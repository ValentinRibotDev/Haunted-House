# Three.js Journey

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

My first ever attempt to use Three.js for a full scene with fog/sky/light/shadow/animation/texture and even more.

All done following the lessons of Bruno Simon on three.js journey !
